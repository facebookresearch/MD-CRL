# Verbose explanation: hydra hijacks the working directory by changing it to the current log directory,
# so it's useful to have this path as a special variable

# resuming from a checkpoint. This argument should be passed to trainer.fit(), not to trainer's __init__. Either set it to null to start from scratch or populate it with a valid ckpt_path to resume training
# note that the ckpt passed here (and not specified in model_name.ckpt) will contain the full training state,
# i.e. callbacks, optimizer states, schedulers, etc. (of course along with the state dict). For passing 
# state dict only, use the respective ckpt config of each model and set this argument to null.
